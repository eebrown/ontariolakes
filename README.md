## Data from the Ontario Lake Partner Program

## Analysis

I have written some R scripts to help analyze the data from the Ontario Lake Partner Program. 
In data_loading.R, there are functions to load the raw data into a format that can more easily 
be analyzed (e.g. converting the dates and coordinates to machine-readable formats). In plots.R 
there are initial plots of the data, with batches to genearte plots for each lakes. The output 
is in the plots directory. If you see an error or otherwise would like to improve the analyses, 
feel free to write an Issue or Pull Request.
